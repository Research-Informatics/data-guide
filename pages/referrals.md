## Referrals

### Overview
Referrals are a critical component of clinical workflows, facilitating the transition of care and ensuring that patients receive the appropriate follow-up or specialized services. Referrals are categorized and managed differently depending on whether they occur in an inpatient or outpatient setting; the CDW-R has accounted for this in their infrastructure and will work with you accordingly.

- **Inpatient Referrals**: Often referred to as consults, these are typically requested by the primary care team during an admission. The goal is to address a specific issue or provide a specialized opinion while the patient remains under inpatient care. Inpatient referrals are closely tied to the context of the admission and are likely resolved before discharge.

- **Outpatient Referrals**: These are often ambulatory referrals initiated during a clinic visit or upon discharge from an inpatient stay. They suggest that care will continue in a subsequent encounter, either with a specialist or a different care team. These referrals are critical for chronic disease management and continuity of care.

- **External Referrals**

### Considerations for Research

- **Setting and Context**: Understand the context of the referral. Inpatient referrals typically indicate acute care needs, while outpatient referrals focus on long-term follow-up or specialized care.

- **Timing and Resolution**: Inpatient consults are generally resolved within the admission, making them useful for studying real-time decision-making and acute care pathways. Outpatient referrals, on the other hand, often lead to subsequent encounters, offering insights into care transitions and adherence to follow-up recommendations.

- **Referral Reasons**: Analyze the reasons for referrals. Common referral reasons include diagnostic uncertainty, specialized procedures, or chronic disease management. These reasons can provide insight into care gaps and clinical decision-making patterns.

- **Data Integration**: Referrals can be linked with other data sources, such as encounter records, lab results, or imaging studies, to build a comprehensive picture of patient care. For example, referrals for oncology may be paired with pathology results to assess diagnostic pathways.

- **Provider and Department Trends**: Evaluate patterns in referral destinations, such as specific departments or providers. This can shed light on institutional workflows and potential bottlenecks in care delivery.

### Future Directions
- Enhancing referral data models to capture outcomes of referrals more consistently, such as whether they resulted in a visit or resolution of the patientâ€™s issue.
- Integrating referral data with patient-reported outcomes to assess the effectiveness of care transitions.
- Expanding analytics to identify gaps in referral completion rates and address barriers to follow-up care.
