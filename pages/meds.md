### Overview
Medication data, including prescription orders and Medication Administration Records (MAR), is a critical resource for understanding treatment patterns, adherence, and outcomes in clinical research. Prescriptions provide insights into what was intended for the patient, while MAR data reflects what was actually administered, including timing and dose adjustments.

This dual perspective can reveal gaps between prescribed and actual care, offering valuable context for studies on medication effectiveness, safety, and patient behavior. For example, researchers can analyze patterns of medication titration in chronic disease management or evaluate adherence to therapy protocols in inpatient and outpatient settings.

The CDW-R supports this work by providing structured access to prescription data and MAR, enabling researchers to query specific medications, dosages, and administration schedules that align with their study goals. 
The CDWR has recently built infrastructure to integrate Surescripts data, enabling researchers to incorporate adherence data into their analyses, offering a more comprehensive view of medication use.



### Considerations for Research

- **Relevance to Research Questions**: Ensure medication data aligns with the specific objectives of your study. For example, focus on insulin dosages for diabetes research or anticoagulant use for cardiovascular studies. Differentiate between prescriptions intended for chronic disease management versus acute treatments.

- **Prescription vs. Administration Data**: Understand the distinctions between prescription data (what was ordered) and MAR data (what was given). Consider how discrepancies between these datasets might inform your research objectives, such as adherence, missed doses, or clinical decision-making.

- **Timing and Context of Administration**: Consider the timing of medication orders and administrations. Inpatient medications may follow different patterns than outpatient prescriptions. Reflect on how timing aligns with clinical events or outcomes of interest (e.g., pre-surgery prophylaxis, post-discharge medication adherence).

- **Prescription vs. Administration Data**: Prescriptions represent the intent of the clinicianâ€”what medication, dosage, and schedule they expect the patient to follow. This data is useful for understanding treatment plans and projected adherence. MAR data, on the other hand, captures what was actually administered, including timing, dose modifications, or omissions. This reflects the reality of medication delivery and provides insight into adherence, patient response, and potential barriers to care. Discrepancies between the two can highlight issues such as medication errors, system inefficiencies, or patient-specific challenges.

- **Standardization and Variability**: Be aware of variations in medication naming conventions (e.g., brand vs. generic names) and standardize data where necessary. Account for variability in dosages, frequency, and routes of administration to ensure accurate analysis.
