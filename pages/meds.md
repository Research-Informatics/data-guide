### Overview
Medication data, including prescription orders and Medication Administration Records (MAR), is a critical resource for understanding treatment patterns, adherence, and outcomes in clinical research. Prescriptions provide insights into what was intended for the patient, while MAR data reflects what was actually administered, including timing and dose adjustments.

This dual perspective can reveal gaps between prescribed and actual care, offering valuable context for studies on medication effectiveness, safety, and patient behavior. For example, researchers can analyze patterns of medication titration in chronic disease management or evaluate adherence to therapy protocols in inpatient and outpatient settings.

The CDW-R supports this work by providing structured access to prescription data and MAR, enabling researchers to query specific medications, dosages, and administration schedules that align with their study goals.
