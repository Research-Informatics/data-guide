Whether you're a seasoned researcher or new to the world of clinical data, this resource is designed to guide you through the complexities of using clinical data effectively, ethically, and responsibly in your studies.

Clinical data is powerful, but navigating its nuances—from data collection and interpretation to addressing biases and ensuring patient privacy—can be daunting. This site provides practical tools, guidance, and insights to empower you, helping you ask the right questions, design meaningful studies, and make data-driven decisions.

## What You’ll Learn
- The basics of clinical data structures, sources, and terminology.
- How to formulate research questions that align with the strengths and limitations of clinical data.
- Practical steps for requesting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing clinical data.
- Key considerations for data governance, compliance, and ethical research practices.

Whether you’re exploring patient outcomes, population health trends, or predictive models, our goal is to demystify the process and provide you with the knowledge to confidently use clinical data in your research. 


The BMC Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R) is a centralized resource to access patient-level and population-level data for research. CDW-R analysts extract and link data from various health system data streams to assist researchers in leverage high-quality data, including data from BMC’s Epic electronic health record (EHR) system, Community Health Center EHR systems, historical legacy clinical systems, and BMC WellSense Health Plan claims. In addition, the CDW-R collaborates with departments, divisions, and research groups to increase research data infrastructure and better leverage data for research purposes. The CDW-R develops and manages clinically-informed algorithms and phenotypes that improve data capture and consistency to identify patient populations, characteristics, and conditions.
