## Using clinical data for Research
Unlocking the potential of clinical data for research can transform how we understand and improve patient care. Whether you're a seasoned researcher or new to the world of clinical data, this resource is designed to guide you through the complexities of using clinical data effectively, ethically, and responsibly in your studies.

Clinical data is powerful, but navigating its nuances—from data collection and interpretation to addressing biases and ensuring patient privacy—can be daunting. This site provides practical tools, guidance, and insights to empower you, helping you ask the right questions, design meaningful studies, and make data-driven decisions.

### What You’ll Learn
- The basics of clinical data structures, sources, and terminology.
- How to formulate research questions that align with the strengths and limitations of clinical data.
- Practical steps for requesting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing clinical data.
- Key considerations for data governance, compliance, and ethical research practices.

Whether you’re exploring patient outcomes, population health trends, or predictive models, our goal is to demystify the process and provide you with the knowledge to confidently use clinical data in your research. 


The BMC Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R) is a centralized resource to access patient-level and population-level data for research. CDW-R analysts extract and link data from various health system data streams to assist researchers in leverage high-quality data, including data from BMC’s Epic electronic health record (EHR) system, Community Health Center EHR systems, historical legacy clinical systems, and BMC WellSense Health Plan claims. In addition, the CDW-R collaborates with departments, divisions, and research groups to increase research data infrastructure and better leverage data for research purposes. The CDW-R develops and manages clinically-informed algorithms and phenotypes that improve data capture and consistency to identify patient populations, characteristics, and conditions. Per hospital policy, data used for research purposes must be provisioned by the CDW-R.

## Research Data versus Operations Data: Key Distinctions
### Regulatory & Compliance
* There are multiple federal laws, state laws, institutional policies, and other regulations that govern
what data, and about whom, can be used for research purposes. The CDW-R works in close
collaboration with the IRB, legal, privacy, and compliance colleagues to respond to evolving systems
and regulations. The CDW-R team specializes in operationalizing compliant research data sets that
abide by these complex regulations. Examples include (but are not limited to):
* Research is required to function based upon the principle of “minimum necessary” under the
HIPAA Privacy Rule, meaning that research datasets must only contain the minimum
necessary data to conduct the research.
* Research studies that require IRB approval may only leverage data and information as
described in the IRB protocol (a means by which to ensure HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance
and the minimum data necessary requirement), and research must abide by applicable laws,
regulations, and required approvals. Part of the CDW-R team serving as the centralized
research entity is to ensure that the patients, encounters, and data provided to study teams
comply with all said laws, regulations, and approvals.
* Some data that can be used for operational purposes cannot be used for research purposes
without additional, special approval(s) – beyond IRB approval (for example, Community
Health Center/OCHIN data; BMC WellSense claims data; data related to Part 2 substance
use clinics).
* Some data are legally not permitted to be used for Research (Care Everywhere data;
Massachusetts Immunization Information Systems (MIIS) data, the immunization data from
MA).
* There are multiple protected populations that need to be removed from all research data sets
unless certain approvals and conditions are met. In addition, there are special encounter
types and particular data fields that also must be removed from all research data sets – even
if the patients are part of the research cohort – because those specific encounters/data
cannot be used for research purposes unless express permissions have been granted by the
IRB and relevant entities. There are also BMC patients who have opted out of having any of
their data used for research purposes that must also be removed from all research data
extracts; the CDW-R manages this ‘opt out’ list.

### Research Rigor & Documentation
* Research (for publication) generally requires a different level of documentation (both for record
keeping and for publication, as at the peer-reviewed level there is focus on reproducibility) than is the
standard for operational data. CDW-R algorithms and data extracts meet research standards.
* Changes in source data systems overtime often leave the data fragmented. The CDW-R has
expertise in working with these legacy systems and combining them with current systems for
longitudinal research.
* Institutional data warehousing and data access channels for the systems analytics teams do not
always meet the needs of researchers (for example, Arcadia includes only a rolling 3 years of claims
data) and may have variability in cohort and dx definitions that for research can cause issues (see
reproducibility above).
