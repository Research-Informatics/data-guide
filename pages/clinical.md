### Using Clinical Data for Research

Clinical data is a valuable resource for research, but using it effectively requires a structured approach. This section provides guidance on identifying a study cohort, defining the data you need, and working with the CDW-R to create research-ready datasets. It also highlights the importance of protecting patient privacy.


#### Identifying a Cohort of Interest
The first step in most studies is defining the population you want to study.  

- **Define the cohort population**: consider factors such as:  
  - Diagnoses (e.g., ICD-10 codes for a specific condition)  
  - Procedures (e.g., CPT codes for surgeries)  
  - Demographics (e.g., age, sex, geographic location)  
  - Encounter types (e.g., inpatient, outpatient)  
  - Timeframe (e.g., patients seen in the last 5 years)  

*Note: the timeframe for identifying the cohort may differ from the timeframe for collecting study data.*  

Once you have a draft definition, consult the CDW-R team. They can validate your criteria and ensure your cohort is both accurate and feasible to extract.  

#### Defining Data Fields for the Cohort
Next, decide what data you need about the cohort. These fields may be different from those used to identify the population.  

- **Common data fields**:  
  - Demographics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity)  
  - Lab results (e.g., hemoglobin, creatinine)  
  - Medications (e.g., prescriptions, administrations)  
  - Procedures (e.g., CPT codes, surgical details)  
  - Vital signs (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate)  

Provide the CDW-R with a clear list of the elements required. They will help extract and prepare the dataset, ensuring completeness and quality.  

> **Note:** The CDW-R follows the *minimum necessary* rule, which means we provide only the data elements required to answer your research question. Study teams are encouraged to request only what is essential, but also to think carefully about which elements are needed to ensure the analysis is robust and meaningful. Being specific helps protect patient privacy and improves the quality of the dataset you receive.


<!--## Protecting Patient Privacy

Maintaining confidentiality and regulatory compliance is critical. All research datasets go through de-identification or anonymization processes before delivery.  

- **De-identification**: removal of direct identifiers (e.g., name, MRN).  
- **Anonymization**: generalization or masking (e.g., date shifting, geographic aggregation).  

Work with the CDW-R to ensure the appropriate level of protection for your study.

By following this process—and partnering with the CDW-R—you can create datasets that are accurate, compliant, and ready for meaningful research.  

<!-- #### 3. Preparing Datasets for Analysis
Once the CDW-R extracts your data, you may need to prepare it further for analysis. Common steps include:
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Address missing or incomplete values.
  - Standardize formats for consistency.
- **Data Harmonization**:
  - Integrate data from multiple sources where necessary.
  - Resolve discrepancies in coding or categorization.
- **Dataset Structuring**:
  - Arrange the data in a format suitable for your analysis, such as wide or long formats.

#### 4. De-identification and Anonymization
Maintaining patient privacy and complying with regulations are critical responsibilities in clinical research. Collaborate with the CDW-R to ensure appropriate de-identification and anonymization measures are applied to your dataset.

- **De-identification**:
  - Remove direct identifiers, such as names or Social Security numbers.
  - Limit access to identifiable information to approved team members.
- **Anonymization**:
  - Generalize or aggregate data to prevent re-identification.
  - Apply date-shifting or geographic masking as needed.
