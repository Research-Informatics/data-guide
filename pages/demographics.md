Demographics represent foundational data in clinical research, capturing key attributes such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, language, and other socio-environmental factors. These variables provide critical context for understanding patient populations. Demographics define the baseline composition of study populations, aiding in subgroup analyses and highlighting variations across age, race, gender, and other attributes.
Demographic data tend to align with requirements from regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, NIH). By carefully leveraging and addressing the complexities of demographic data, researchers can enhance the validity, equity, and impact of their studies.

### Considerations for Use in Research:

- Self-reported demographics may vary in accuracy, while institutional biases in documentation (e.g., underreporting of race or ethnicity) can lead to gaps in data. Missing data for key variables like race or language can hinder analyses, requiring imputation or exclusion strategies.
- Granularity and Standardization: Race, ethnicity, and country of origin often require harmonization to align with federal or research-specific standards.
- Binary fields like sex assigned at birth may not fully represent gender diversity; careful consideration of evolving standards is essential.
- Protecting sensitive demographic data, such as country of origin or immigration status, is critical to prevent misuse or stigmatization. **These data are addressed in the special populations section.**
- Certain fields, like marital status or education, may change over time, while others, like sex assigned at birth, are static. Understanding the temporal relevance of demographics is crucial when using the data; these data are the data available within patient registration at the time of data extraction and may be out of date.
