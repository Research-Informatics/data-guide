### Considerations for Notes in Research

Clinical provide rich, unstructured data that capture the nuances of patient care, often unavailable in structured fields. These notes can include progress notes, operative reports, discharge summaries, and other documentation.

#### **Key Considerations**
- **Unstructured Text**: Notes require Natural Language Processing (NLP) or manual review to extract actionable data, such as symptoms, clinical impressions, or treatment plans.
- **Note Types**: Filter notes by type (e.g., progress notes, discharge summaries) to align with research objectives. For instance, use discharge summaries for transitions of care studies.
- **Timing and Amendments**: Notes can be created, amended, or cancelled over time. Researchers should verify the status and consider timestamps (creation, signing) for context.
- **Linking to Other Data**: Notes can provide insights into encounters, orders, and other clinical events, serving as a bridge between structured and unstructured data.

#### **CDWR Support**
The CDW-R integrates note metadata with encounter-level and structured data, enabling seamless linkage for research. Additionally, it offers tools to apply NLP on note text, extracting structured insights like clinical terms, diagnoses, and treatment plans while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
