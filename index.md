Whether you’re exploring patient outcomes, population health trends, or predictive models, our goal is to demystify the process and provide you with the knowledge to confidently use clinical data in your research. 

### The BMC Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R)
The [BMC CDW-R](https://www.bmc.org/research/clinical-data-warehouse-cdw) is a centralized resource to access patient-level and population-level data for research. CDW-R analysts extract and link data from various health system data streams to assist researchers in leverage high-quality data, including data from BMC’s Epic electronic health record (EHR) system, Community Health Center EHR systems, historical legacy clinical systems, and BMC WellSense Health Plan claims. In addition, the CDW-R collaborates with departments, divisions, and research groups to increase research data infrastructure and better leverage data for research purposes. The CDW-R develops and manages clinically-informed algorithms and phenotypes that improve data capture and consistency to identify patient populations, characteristics, and conditions.
