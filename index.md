## Using clinical data for Research
Unlocking the potential of clinical data can transform how we understand and improve patient care. Whether you are an experienced investigator or new to working with research data, this resource is here to guide you in using clinical data effectively, ethically, and responsibly.  

Clinical data is powerful, but it comes with complexity—from collection and interpretation to bias, privacy, and governance. This site provides practical tools, definitions, and guidance to help you ask the right questions, design meaningful studies, and make informed decisions.  

### What You’ll Learn
- The basics of clinical data structures, sources, and terminology.  
- The types of data available and how to select what best fits your study.  
- How to make the most of the Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R).  
- Practical steps for requesting and receiving a dataset.  
- Key considerations for governance, compliance, and ethical use.  

Whether you’re studying patient outcomes, population health, or predictive models, our goal is to demystify the process and provide the knowledge you need to use clinical data with confidence.  


## Scope & Use  

This guide is designed for investigators and study teams who need to work with clinical data in research. It focuses on data concepts, availability, and responsible use—not programming or technical code.  

It complements, but does not replace, training or consultation with the Research Data & Informatics team. Use it as a starting point and reference when planning or carrying out your studies.

### The BMC Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R)
The [BMC CDW-R](https://www.bmc.org/research/clinical-data-warehouse-cdw) is a centralized resource to access patient-level and population-level data for research. CDW-R analysts extract and link data from various health system data streams to assist researchers in leverage high-quality data, including data from BMC’s Epic electronic health record (EHR) system, Community Health Center EHR systems, historical legacy clinical systems, and BMC WellSense Health Plan claims. In addition, the CDW-R collaborates with departments, divisions, and research groups to increase research data infrastructure and better leverage data for research purposes. The CDW-R develops and manages clinically-informed algorithms and phenotypes that improve data capture and consistency to identify patient populations, characteristics, and conditions.
